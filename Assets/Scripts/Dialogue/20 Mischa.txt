Mischa! Why are you always running off like that? Thank you a lot for finding her!
Jasmin
She was not too far away, just walking around and exploring the city!
Margarita
Yes, she likes to go outside and watch the birds. Every time she goes off she is coming back again, because she gets hungry eventually. 
But this time I seriously thought I will never see her again, so really, thank you!
Jasmin
No problem!
