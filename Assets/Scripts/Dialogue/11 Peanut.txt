Peanut?! Oh my god there you are you bastard! We've been looking all over town for you!
Where have you been, hiding out in the bushes again?
Jasmin
I found him chilling in the park! He really likes exploring, I think I almost accidentally chased him up a tree!
Leon
Oh no! My sister actually did that once, she was out with Peanut and accidentally stepped on his tail!
He got so mad, and ran away, leash and all.
I ended up finding him in the trees. He was safe, but we had to cut the leash up since it got tangled in the branches.
Jasmin
Ooh, hope you weren't too attached to that leash.
Leon
It's whatever. Peanut refused to look at my sister for a week!
He eventually forgave her though.
After a lot of coaxing.
And apologies.
And treats.
Jasmin
Hahaha! I bet he loved those consolation treats!
Leon
He did, that greedy little man. He now chirps whenever my sister's around so she can hear him.
It's super sweet.
Anyways, I've taken too much of your time! Thank you so much for finding Peanut!
Jasmin
No problem!
