Oh.... thank you so much for finding him, I've missed him so much.
Jasmin
Yeah no problem! He's really sweet!

The other day, we tried to put a collar on him in case we lost him.
The collar kept comming off though
Couldn't for the life of us work out why he kept taking them off.
Good thing he's microchipped though...
Thanks though...
Jasmin
Y-yeah, no problem.
