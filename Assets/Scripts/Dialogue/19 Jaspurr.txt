Jas- he's back! My dude seriously got lost while chasing pigeons after they ate his bread.
Although I instantly ran after, I couldn't find him. Dude just dashed forward like a rocket. 
Hope he stayed out of trouble.
Jasmin
I guess he was exhausted after that, I found him in a quite calm condition.
Ahmad
Thats my boi! Probably crashed all those poor pigeons and got his bread back. No wonder he is so sleepy right now.
*Lifts Jaspurr up* 
Damn, he probably ate those pigeons as well, ha ha.
Jasmin
Haha...
Ahmad
Thanks again! I don't know what I would do without my Jaspurr!
Jasmin
No problem!
