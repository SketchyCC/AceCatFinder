CLEO! Oh no, her fur is full of sand!!
Did she ran off to the park again?
Jasmin
Yeah, kind of..
Chloe
I thought about it.
She has this weird obsession with digging in the sandpits for children at the park.
Jasmin
Maybe she is digging holes to hide something in there.
Chloe
Cleo, do you have something to hide?
...
Why are you looking at me like that? 
...
Anyway, thank you for finding her!
*sigh* I am already looking forward to bathe her...
