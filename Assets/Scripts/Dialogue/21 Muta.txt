My dear, my dear! Thank you for finding Muta!
You look exhausted, would you like some tea? 
Jasmin
I wish, but there are still plenty of owners who miss their cats! The more I wait the more  likely the cats could be lost forever!
Iris
That is indeed true, but you also can't catch any more cats when you're completely worn out.
Don't forget to take care of yourself! Sometimes it is important to rest and enjoy the moment. Especially since time is so limited these days. 
Jasmin
I will consider that, thank you!
Iris
*sigh* Then I don't want to hold you up any longer, have a nice day!
