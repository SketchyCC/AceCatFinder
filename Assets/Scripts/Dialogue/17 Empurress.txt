Poor, poor baby - I hope you were okay outside!
Jasmin
Yes, I found her wandering around.

Empurress is a pedigree cat and has already won many competitions! I can not imagine what would happen if she lost the beautiful brilliance of her fur! Fortunately, she herself is also from a royal family and knows how to behave. Isn't that right, my darling?
*Empurress rolls her eyes dramatically and begins to purr*
Jasmin
Glad to hear that!
Fiona
Thanks for your help, now I can finally prepare her for the next competition!
