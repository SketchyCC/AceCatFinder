Ronnie! Wow, I'm impressed, you managed to catch him.
Jasmin
Yeah, hahaha, he was a nimble boy, it took me so long to get him!
Neil
That's like, super cool. I usually need to arm myself with 5 packs of treats to lure him out.
One time we had to take him to the vet. Got the cat carrier out.
But like, they know what's up. He ran around the house twice, knocked over a lot of books, and managed to hide in the corner of the sofa.
And by corner I mean he got stuck under the corner of the sofa.
Jasmin
Ooof that sounds like a lot.
Neil
Yeah, it was pretty funny though, seeing him stuck there. Couldn't help but snap a few pics before pulling him out.
And sticking him into the cat cage.
Jasmin
Naughty cats go in the timeout cage?
Neil
Hell of a timeout since we took him to the vet, lol.
Anyways, thank you so much for catching him!
