Curry! Oh come here you cutie pie, I thought I'd never see you again!
Oh my god, thank you so much, Jasmin, you're such a sweetheart!
Going through all that to find my little Curry pie for me!
I hope she wasn't too much trouble!
Jasmin
Absolutely not! I missed seeing her from your restaurant, so I knew I had to find her!
How she doing right now?
Roux
Lounging in front of the windows again, in her usual spot!
Oh, thank you again! 
I'll treat you to something good the next time you drop by!
Jasmin
Looking forward to it!
