Bumblebee! Glad I can finally cuddle with him again!
Jasmin
He surely is a soft boy!
Lorenzo
Yes, he takes a lot of care after his fur. Sometimes I just reach out to pet him and he will already start to clean himself energetically. 
That's pretty nice, since he is so clean, but can you imagine what it's like when spring starts?
I have to clean up his hairballs and sometimes he is even throwing them up! Poor guy..
Jasmin
Yeah, long haired cats have a pretty bad time when it's hot outside.
Lorenzo
Anyway, thank you for bringing him back! I owe you something!
