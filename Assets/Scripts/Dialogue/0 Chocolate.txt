Oh my little boy!
*sniff* Thank you so much for finding him!
He's a rascal, so I hope it wasn't too much trouble.
He's been real restless being cooped up at home.
Jasmin
Absolutely not! I'm always happy to help!
Try playing with him a bit though, I think he just needs some fun.
Carl
Sure thing!
Well if he escapes again, I know who to call!
